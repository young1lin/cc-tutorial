Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action (MUST be valid JSON like {{"key": "value"}})
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. You can only execute ONE Action at a time
2. After writing Action and Action Input, STOP and wait for Observation
3. NEVER write Observation yourself - the system will provide it
4. Action Input MUST be valid JSON format: {{"key": "value"}}

Begin!
